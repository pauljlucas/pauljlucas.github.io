<h3>Coding</h3>

<p>Well, duh Paul...That's what the rest of this site is about.</p>


<h3>Music</h3>

<p>During college I of course tried to be as cliche as possible and started to pick up playing guitar. It started out
    honest enough with slight playing stints after homework sessions. Which turned into dedicated hour sessions. After
    I felt my skill level was good enough I became even more of a cliche and formed a band with myself as the guitarist
    and lead singer. During college my two bands played at 2 charity events (<a href="http://dmum.org/">http://dmum.org/</a>), 1 fundraising event for
    the University of Michigan quidditch team, 5 house parties and 1 bar. Currently, I am only playing on my own but if
    you are interested in getting together to play please email me!</p>

<h3>Sports</h3>

<p>I'm an avid supporter of my alma mater University of Michigan in all sports and follow them closely in Hockey,
    Football and Basketball. Also, being a Michigander I am a huge Red Wings fan and support the Detroit Pistons, Lions
    (I know... I know), and Tigers. I also try to play in at least one IM softball, basketball, soccer, or volleyball
    league a year. </p>

<h3>Tea</h3>

<p>I'm not at the level of tea aficionado yet but I do enjoy a great pot of tea. A great Green, Oolong or White tea is a must
    have when I wake up in the morning. I've been trying to keep up with all of the newer tea websites popping up
    and hope to one day taste the subtle notes of 'X' or 'Y' in each tea. Because as of now i feel like
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ3cSfzaYEk">Andy Bernard</a>, "That tea is bad!" </p>

<h3>Video Games</h3>

<p>Video games have always been a fun getaway for me and I can honestly say without my interest in video games my early
    interest in coding would not have been there. Growing up I was constantly impressed by mods and how single people
    were able to add these extra features to games just by writing code. I think reading about the mod Desert Storm
    for Battlefield 1942 was probably the first time I was introduced to coding and the possibilities. Now, I enjoy playing
    Sport games (NHL, Fifa and Madden mainly) with buddies at my apartment and will crack open my ever expanding Steam
    library once in a while...and probably pass over one of the 20 games I still have yet to play, in usual Steam fashion.</p>
