<h3>Text-Bomber <code> - Released September 2010</code> </h3>
<p>Back in a day when smart phones were not as popular as dumb phones (hard to imagine!) I decided to take advantage
    of my coding skills and access to 'open-source' software to prank my friends with dumb phones. Thus Text-Bomber
    was born. It allowed users to send a set number of the same messages to one person making their dumb phone utterly
    useless. It was a great idea in a closed environment because my friends and I could do it to each other and get
    a laugh out of it without worrying about the amount of text messages sent because we had unlimited plans. </p>
<p>
    Soon after I released it to the Google Play store (back when it was called Android Market) and sold ~1000 paid
    copies and ~7500 free downloads. After receiving a few emails from people on the receiving end of
    Text-Bomber who had their cell phone bills shoot through the roof it hit me this could be used maliciously.
    I still remember the terrible feeling I had when I read some of the emails and that has always impacted how and
    why I makes applications to this day. As I deliberated taking it down because of the malicious users, Google
    made the choice for me because it was against their TOS to spam the cellular networks (rightfully so).
    Now Text-Bomber is bombed but it was a great learning experience.</p>

<h3>Remoto <code> - Released February 2011 </code></h3>
<p>Following Text-Bomber I was seeing a need for getting information from your phone when you wern't around it, specifically
    when it was lost. At the time, phone GPS' were not being used to help find your lost phone and seeing a vast majority
    of people losing there phones in plain sight I decided to make an app. Rather than a Web Interface to find it, I used
    text messages with keywords and passwords to send the command to play a sound, return back GPS coordinates and other
    features. It received around 800 downloads and I didn't continue to support the application because many apps soon
    after came out to do this in a much more elegant way.</p>
